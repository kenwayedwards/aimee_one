Statements of Maintenance Upgrade for Katie to be given to Mr. Maverick

Your car comes standard with 2 years or 25,000 miles of free basic maintenance.
This is good at all Toyota dealerships nationwide and Toyota has approved you for a maintenance upgrade which increases your coverage to 75,000 miles.
With a maintenance upgrade, whenever your car has a maintenance due, all required services will be taken care of and paid for by us 100% parts and 100% labor.
Toyota technicians know your Toyota 4 Runner best, and as I mentioned before, our mission is to save you money and keep your Toyota in peak conditions.
Now that we have discussed about the  maintenance upgrade, would you like to end this conversation ?


75,000 miles are 1,20,700 kilometers
